# Time_Calculator
Time Calculator for FCC Python Cert.

This is passing code for the second FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python challenge. It calculates a new time based on the inputted time and a duration, optionally calculating the day based on an inputted day. It first parses the string and separates out the hour, minute, and meridian variables, calculating total minutes for the time and the duration. It then adds those times and outputs a new time, with adjustments made along the way to compensate for the meridian. It then calculates a new day, if inputted, and the new meridian. Finally, it formats all these variables into a string and returns it. 


Update (12-16-23): I've gone back and updated the calculator, greatly simplifying the math and cleaning up a few miscellaneous issues.
