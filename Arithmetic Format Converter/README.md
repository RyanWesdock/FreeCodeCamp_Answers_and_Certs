Passing code for FreeCodeCamp's first Scientific Computing with Python certification test, which no longer exists.
The goal of the assignment was to take a list of strings of arithmetic problems and output them vertically, like they would appear in an elementary school workbook. 
The function that did this was also required to take an optional parameter which requested the answer to the problem. 
It needed to output one of four error messages under certain conditions.

The Arithmetic_Converter.py file was my original, passing submission. The arithmetic_rearranger.py file is my second, recent attempt. I am unable to test it against
FCC's tests for validation, however, it does seem to have the same output as the original function. I recalled the function was difficult for me, so I wanted to take
redo it now that I have more coding experience. With a greater grasp of syntax (especially for formatting strings), I was able to greatly reduce and simplify the
labyrinthine code of the original. I have included both here for reference.
